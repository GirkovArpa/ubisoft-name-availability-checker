# Ubisoft Name Availability Checker

A simple [Sciter](https://sciter.com) wrapper for the https://r6.apitab.com/namecheck/ API.

Inspired by [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/programmingrequests/comments/j1gb5x/uplay_username_checker/) Reddit thread.

## Usage

Download whichever "scapp.exe" corresponds to your machine from [here](https://github.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/tree/master).

For example, if you're on Windows 64bit:

https://github.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk/tree/master/bin.win/x64/scapp.exe

Put it in the same folder as "main.html" and "main.tis" and run it.
